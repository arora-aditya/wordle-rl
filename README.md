# Wordle RL

The aim of this project is to build an AI bot that can play the [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) game, or more generally [Squabble](squabble.me/)

I know there are more deterministic approaches using statistics and log-likelihood that might be more efficient, but I am trying this to for the clickbait title that I'd give my blog if this ends up working

## Current status
- [x] Setup wordle-gym environment
- [x] Train some basic algorithms
- [ ] Finetune the RL algos to be performant
- [ ] Generalize to Squabble esque environment
